## 1. What IDML is

IDML (InDesign Markup Language) is Adobe InDesign's XML-based interchange
format, introduced with InDesign CS4. It is the backward-compatible,
inspectable alternative to the binary `.indd` format. An IDML file represents
the objects and properties of an InDesign document as XML elements and
attributes.

A `.idml` file is a **ZIP archive**. It can be unpacked with any ZIP tool
(`unzip`, Expand-Archive, etc.) and read without launching InDesign.

The XML namespace used by package-level wrapper elements is:

```
http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/idml/1.0/packaging
```

This is the canonical Adobe packaging namespace and is referenced in the
converter as `IDML_NS`.

---

## 2. Package layout

When unpacked, an IDML package contains the following top-level parts. The
converter only reads `designmap.xml` and the `Stories/` directory; the rest is
listed for context.

```
MyDocument-IDML/
├── mimetype                 First entry; contains the IDML MIME type string
├── META-INF/
│   ├── container.xml        Identifies the root content file (designmap.xml)
│   └── manifest.xml         Lists all parts in the package
├── designmap.xml            Master manifest — lists every component + reading order
├── Resources/
│   ├── Fonts.xml
│   ├── Graphic.xml
│   ├── Preferences.xml
│   └── Styles.xml           Global paragraph/character/object/table style defs
├── Styles/                  (style definition parts, when present)
├── Stories/
│   ├── Story_<id>.xml       One file per story (text flow) — THE TEXT CONTENT
│   └── ...
├── Spreads/
│   ├── Spread_<id>.xml      Page/spread layout: text frames, image frames, geometry
│   └── ...
├── MasterSpreads/
│   └── MasterSpread_<id>.xml Master page definitions (headers, footers, grids)
└── XML/
    ├── BackingStory.xml     Top-level content↔structure associations
    ├── Tags.xml
    └── Mapping.xml
```

> **Note on layouts**: Some export tools produce a *flat* layout where
> `Story_*.xml` files sit in the package root rather than inside `Stories/`.
> The converter's `discover_stories()` checks both the root and `Stories/`.

---

## 3. File nomenclature

| Part | Filename pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Master manifest | `designmap.xml` | Always present at package root. The converter globs `designmap*.xml`. |
| Story | `Story_<Self>.xml` | `<Self>` is the story's `Self` identifier (e.g. `Story_u145de.xml`). |
| Spread | `Spread_<Self>.xml` | One per spread. |
| Master spread | `MasterSpread_<Self>.xml` | One per master page. |

The `<id>` / `<Self>` portion is an opaque InDesign object identifier, usually
prefixed with `u` followed by a base-36-like string (e.g. `u145de`). It is
**not** a sequential page number and carries no inherent ordering — ordering
comes from `designmap.xml` (see §5).

---

## 4. designmap.xml

`designmap.xml` is the master manifest. It contains a single `<Document>`
element that references every other part of the package via `idPkg:`-namespaced
child elements.

Minimal example (from the IDML cookbook):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<?aid style="50" type="document" readerVersion="6.0" featureSet="257"?>
<Document
  xmlns:idPkg="http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/idml/1.0/packaging"
  DOMVersion="7.0" Self="d">
  <idPkg:Spread src="Spreads/Spread_spread1.xml"/>
  <idPkg:Story src="Stories/Story_story1.xml"/>
</Document>
```

Key attributes the converter uses:

- **`StoryList`** (on `<Document>`): a space-separated list of story `Self`
  identifiers in InDesign's canonical reading order. This is the primary
  signal the converter uses to order stories. See `get_story_order()`.
- **`idPkg:Story/@src`**: relative path to each story XML file. Used as a
  fallback ordering source when `StoryList` is absent.

---

## 5. Determining reading order

Stories in `Stories/` are stored without inherent order; a story is text
content abstracted from its placement. To reconstruct document reading order:

1. **Primary method (converter default)**: read the `StoryList` attribute on
   the `<Document>` element in `designmap.xml`. It enumerates story `Self` IDs
   in page order.
2. **Fallback method**: if `StoryList` is absent, the converter collects
   `idPkg:Story/@src` references in document order.

> **Authoritative cross-check (per Adobe/community reference)**: the fully
> rigorous method walks the layout — read spread order from `designmap.xml`,
> then within each `Spread_*.xml` read `<TextFrame>` order and follow each
> frame's `ParentStory` reference to the matching `Story_*.xml`. The converter
> uses the simpler `StoryList` approach, which is sufficient for
> single-frame-per-story documents. **A senior developer extending this tool
> for complex multi-frame threaded layouts should implement the
> spread→TextFrame→ParentStory walk.**

---

## 6. Story XML structure

Each `Story_*.xml` file is wrapped in an `idPkg:Story` packaging element and
contains a `<Story>` element. Text is organised as a hierarchy:

```
<idPkg:Story>
  <Story Self="...">
    <ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/...">
      <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="CharacterStyle/...">
        <Content>The actual text</Content>
      </CharacterStyleRange>
    </ParagraphStyleRange>
  </Story>
</idPkg:Story>
```

### Element reference

| Element | Meaning | Converter usage |
|---|---|---|
| `<Story>` | The text flow container | Root iterated via `root.iter("ParagraphStyleRange")` |
| `<ParagraphStyleRange>` | A run of text sharing one paragraph style | One paragraph; mapped to a semantic role |
| `<CharacterStyleRange>` | A run within a paragraph sharing one character style | Inline bold/italic detection; `PointSize` inspection for headline heuristic |
| `<Content>` | The literal text string | Concatenated to build paragraph text |
| `<Br/>` | Forced line/paragraph break | Converted to Markdown hard break (two trailing spaces + newline) |

### Key attributes

| Attribute | On element | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AppliedParagraphStyle` | `ParagraphStyleRange` | The paragraph style, e.g. `ParagraphStyle/$ID/Title 1`. The converter strips the `ParagraphStyle/` / `$ID/` prefix and lowercases it (`normalize_style()`), then maps it via `styles.toml`. |
| `AppliedCharacterStyle` | `CharacterStyleRange` | The character style, e.g. `CharacterStyle/$ID/[No character style]`. Inspected for bold/italic keywords. |
| `FontStyle` | `CharacterStyleRange` / `Properties` | Font weight/style name (e.g. `Bold`, `Italic`, `Semibold`). The converter scans this for bold/italic keywords defined in `styles.toml`. |
| `PointSize` | `CharacterStyleRange` / `Properties/PointSize` | Font size in points. Read by `_paragraph_point_size()` for the headline promotion heuristic (v1.4.0). |

> **Style name nomenclature**: paragraph/character style references take the
> form `<Type>/<group?>/$ID/<name>` or `<Type>/<name>`. The `$ID/` segment
> denotes an application-default (untranslated) style name. `normalize_style()`
> handles both by taking the final path segment.

### Special characters

InDesign encodes certain non-text markers as processing instructions inside
`<Content>`, e.g. an auto page-number marker:

```xml
<Content><?ACE 18?></Content>
```

These are not plain text and may require special handling if encountered.

---

## 7. Styles: local vs. global

- **Global styles** are defined once in `Resources/Styles.xml` (and the
  `Styles/` parts): the catalogue of all paragraph, character, object, and
  table styles, with their full formatting properties.
- **Local styles / overrides** are expressed inline within story files on the
  `ParagraphStyleRange` / `CharacterStyleRange` elements.

The converter relies on the **style name reference** (the `AppliedParagraphStyle`
attribute), not on resolving the full style definition from `Resources/`. This
is why the `styles.toml` mapping is keyed by style *name*, not by resolved
visual formatting.

---

## 8. Headline font-size heuristic (v1.4.0)

Some InDesign layouts — particularly special pages with coloured backgrounds —
use oversized body text to create large headlines instead of applying a heading
paragraph style. Because the converter maps roles by paragraph style name, these
pages were previously indistinguishable from ordinary body text and would not
be recognised as separate Teachfloor content elements.

### Problem

A layout artist increases the `PointSize` on a `Normal` (body) paragraph to,
say, 56 pt to achieve a large headline appearance. No heading paragraph style
is applied, so `styles.toml` maps it to `body`. The paragraph flows into the
surrounding text and no new element boundary is created in the Teachfloor
output.

### Solution

Version 1.4.0 adds a size-based promotion step inside `parse_story()`:

1. The paragraph style is resolved to a role as usual.
2. If the resolved role is `body` and `headline_point_size > 0` (from
   `styles.toml [settings]`), `_paragraph_point_size()` scans each
   `CharacterStyleRange` for `PointSize` attributes — both inline on the
   element and nested inside `<Properties><PointSize>` — and returns the
   maximum.
3. If the maximum point size is >= `headline_point_size`, the role is
   overridden to `element_title`.

### Attribute locations

`PointSize` can appear in two places within a `CharacterStyleRange`:

```xml
<!-- Inline attribute -->
<CharacterStyleRange PointSize="56" ...>
  <Content>Large headline text</Content>
</CharacterStyleRange>

<!-- Nested Properties element -->
<CharacterStyleRange ...>
  <Properties>
    <PointSize type="unit">56</PointSize>
  </Properties>
  <Content>Large headline text</Content>
</CharacterStyleRange>
```

`_paragraph_point_size()` checks both locations and returns the maximum value
found across all `CharacterStyleRange` children of the paragraph.

### Configuration

```toml
[settings]
headline_point_size = 40.0   # promote body >= 40 pt to element_title
# headline_point_size = 0    # set to 0 to disable entirely
```

The default is `40.0` pt. Inspect the actual font sizes used for special pages
in your document and adjust accordingly.

## 9. What the converter deliberately ignores

| IDML feature | Location | Why ignored |
|---|---|---|
| Images / graphics | `Spreads/`, `Resources/` | Text-only conversion |
| Tables | `<Table>` in stories | Not supported |
| Footnotes | `<Footnote>` in stories | Dropped |
| Layout geometry | `Spreads/`, `MasterSpreads/` | Reading order taken from `StoryList` instead |
| Style definitions | `Resources/Styles.xml` | Mapping is by style name, not resolved formatting |
| Hyperlinks | story / `designmap.xml` | Not extracted |
